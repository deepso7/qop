- Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ and skills before writing any code.

## Vendored Repositories

This project vendors external repositories under `.repos/` as read-only reference material for coding agents.

- Prefer examples and patterns from the vendored source code over generated guesses or web search results.
- Do not edit files under `.repos/` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not import from `.repos/`; application code must continue importing from normal package dependencies.
- When updating a dependency with a configured vendored subtree, sync that subtree in the same change so `.repos/` matches the installed dependency version.
- When writing Effect code, read `.repos/effect/LLMS.md` first and inspect `.repos/effect/` for examples of idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.
